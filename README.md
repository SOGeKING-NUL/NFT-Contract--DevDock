# Mutant NFT Contract - DevDock

## 🧬 Mutant NFT System
A unique and innovative NFT fusion mechanism that allows the creation of **Mutant NFTs** by merging two distinct NFT collections, each with specialized traits. This dynamic system introduces strategic collection mechanics and enhances NFT utility.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔹 Dual Base Collections
- **BaseNFT1 (Warriors)**: Strength, Agility, and Species traits
- **BaseNFT2 (Mages)**: Magic, Intelligence, and Elemental traits

### 🔗 Fusion Mechanics
- Merge two NFTs (one from each collection) to create a **Mutant NFT**
- The new NFT inherits all traits from both parent NFTs
- **One-time fusion**: Parent NFTs are permanently marked as merged

### ⚙️ Trait Inheritance
- Complete preservation of traits from both parents
- Unique combinations of **physical and magical attributes**
- Each Mutant NFT carries **six distinct traits**

## 🔒 Security & Reliability
- **Ownership verification** ensures only the rightful owner can merge NFTs
- **Anti-duplicate protection** prevents multiple fusions with the same NFTs
- **Permanent merge records** maintain integrity and uniqueness
- Built using **OpenZeppelin’s secure ERC721 implementation**

## 💎 Unique Value Proposition
This contract **gamifies NFT ownership**, encouraging collectors to acquire both Warrior and Mage NFTs to unlock powerful Mutant NFTs. By introducing a **strategic merging system**, it adds long-term engagement, rarity, and value to the ecosystem.
